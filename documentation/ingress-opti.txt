Basic rules / info
==================
* portal is defined by its coordonates (longitude/latitude)
* a (potential) link is a line between two portals
* a link is valid only if it doesn't cross an existing link
* a field is a triangle formed by 3 valid links
* a field can be included in another field
* a link can be used for several link
* a cartography is a list of used valid links
* a link is oriented. It goes from an origin portal to a target portal
* a portal can be the origin of a maxium of 8 links
* a portal can be the destination/target of an unlimited number of links

Algorithm
=========
1/ based on the list of portals, generate all the potential links
2/ define a method to check if a link cross an other link

3/ generate a cartography: 
for each link:
	a/ check if it cross a previous validated link (if no previous link, then it's valid)
	b/ if link not valid, "continue to 3"
	c/ generate a sub-cartography (recc call to 3) considering the current link is used
	d/ generate a sub-cartography (recc call to 3) considering the current link is not used
	e/ return the best result between "c" and "d"
	
4/ define a "score" function to compute the number of fields in a cartography
